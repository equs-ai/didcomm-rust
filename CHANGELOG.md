# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here.

This is a fork of [sicpa-dlab/didcomm-rust](https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/didcomm-rust),
diverged at `9e79b48`.

### Changed

- `askar-crypto` comes from crates.io instead of a pinned `aries-askar` git
  revision, at `=0.3.3` (up from 0.2). The pin is exact: 0.3.6 added prehashed
  `SignatureType` variants that `KnownSignatureType` does not cover. `ES384`
  added for exhaustiveness.
- `uuid` gains the `stdweb` feature so v4 generation works on `wasm32`.
- Published as `equs-didcomm`; the library target stays `didcomm`, so
  `use didcomm::…` is unchanged.
